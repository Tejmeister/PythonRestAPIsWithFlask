[_TOC_]
# Introduction
This Project contains the code which I developed while learning REST APIs in python using Flask from the course https://www.udemy.com/course/rest-api-flask-and-python/

# Section 3

The code in this section includes a simple Flask app and a HTML and JavaScript file which calls the Flask app endpoints.

# Section 4

The code in this section includes a Flask app which is an API that represents items. It also includes user registration and authentication.

# Section 5

The code in this section extends the last section by adding persistent storage of Items to a SQLite database.

# Section 6

The code in this section extends the previous section by replacing the manual integration with SQLite, with SQLAlchemy—an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)—which allows us to easily replace SQLite with something like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
